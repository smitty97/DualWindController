And the arduino code posted here

Use a SPDT ON-OFF-ON switch on pins 2, 3, 14(gnd) for switching between manual and simulator control.   A 10k potentiometer is used for manual control (and max sim-controlled wind)

I supply the dual motor shield with 24v and run 2x seaflow fans.  You can probably run 12v fans also.
